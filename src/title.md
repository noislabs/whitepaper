# Nois Network

Nois Network aims to bring randomness (or noise) to the Cosmos ecosystem by providing a safe and secure entropy source and distributing randomness in the form of [random beacons][cryptographic-beacons] to other Cosmos blockchains via [IBC].

## Definitions

In this context we talk about public randomness, i.e. values that are unpredictable for all participants but once they are revealed, they are free to share. Private randomness that needs to be kept secret by one or some participants is out of scope for this document.
